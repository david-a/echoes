You're absolutely right! "K-Pop Demon Hunters" has a similar concept - it's about a K-pop group that secretly hunts demons, combining music with supernatural action. Given your series' themes of music, resistance, and mystical powers, here are 20 alternative names inspired by that naming style:

## 20 Alternative Names (K-Pop Demon Hunters Style)

### **Music + Supernatural Action:**
1. **Rune Warriors**
2. **Echo Hunters**
3. **Rune Rebels**
4. **Echo Warriors**
5. **Rune Defenders**

### **Music + Resistance:**
6. **Echo Resistance**
7. **Rune Revolutionaries**
8. **Echo Defenders**
9. **Rune Freedom Fighters**
10. **Echo Liberation**

### **Music + Awakening:**
11. **Rune Awakeners**

### **Bonus - More Descriptive:**
21. **Rune Music Warriors**
22. **Echo Rune Hunters**
23. **Rune Echo Defenders**

These follow the pattern of combining your musical element ("Echo" or "Rune") with an action/role word, similar to how "K-Pop Demon Hunters" combines music genre + supernatural role. The names emphasize both the musical aspect and the heroic/resistance elements of your story.

Which style resonates most with your vision for the series?
