I'll add cool-sounding demonyms for each species in the Resources.md file. Let me first read the current content to see which species already have demonyms and which ones need them.

Read file: Resources.md

Now let me check the beginning of the species section to see the Enosh species:

Perfect! Now I can see which species need demonyms. I can see that:

1. **Enosh** - needs a demonym
2. **Sylvari** - already has "Sylvari" as demonym
3. **Aquarii** - already has "Aquarii" as demonym  
4. **Ferox** - needs a demonym
5. **Mechani** - needs a demonym
6. **Umbra** - needs a demonym
7. **Celestials** - needs a demonym

Let me add cool-sounding demonyms for the species that don't have them yet:

Perfect! I've added cool-sounding demonyms for all the species that didn't have them yet:

1. **Enosh** → **Enoshian** - Sounds sophisticated and authoritative, fitting for the dominant species
2. **Ferox** → **Feroxian** - Maintains the wild, fierce sound of the original name
3. **Mechani** → **Mechanite** - Has a technological, constructed sound that fits their nature
4. **Umbra** → **Umbral** - Mysterious and shadowy, perfect for the shadow dwellers
5. **Celestials** → **Celestial** - Simple but elegant, fitting for the dimensional beings

The existing demonyms were preserved:
- **Sylvari** → **Sylvari** (already had this)
- **Aquarii** → **Aquarii** (already had this)

All the demonyms now have a cohesive, sci-fi/fantasy feel that fits well with the world-building of your animated music series!

I like Umbral and Celestial but Enoshian, Feroxian and Mechanite sounds weird and dull

You're absolutely right! Those demonyms do sound a bit generic. Let me come up with more creative and fitting names for those species:

Much better! Here are the improved demonyms:

1. **Enosh** → **Enoshite** - Sounds more sophisticated and less generic than "Enoshian"
2. **Ferox** → **Feroxi** - More dynamic and wild-sounding, fits their beast-like nature
3. **Mechani** → **Mechanoid** - More sci-fi and descriptive of their constructed nature

These new demonyms have more character and sound more fitting for your animated series world!
