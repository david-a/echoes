Based on the comprehensive character information from your Echoes series, here's a detailed text2img prompt for Ayala:

**Character: Ayala (Aleph - Wild Power)**

**Physical Description:**
A young female humanoid with an athletic, gazelle-like build, standing approximately 5'8" tall. She has a slender but muscular frame that suggests natural agility and strength. Her skin has a subtle iridescent quality typical of the Enosh species, with a warm golden undertone that glows faintly when her powers activate.

**Facial Features:**
Sharp, alert features with high cheekbones and a defined jawline. Her eyes are large and expressive, with a distinctive golden amber color that intensifies to a bright glow when her ot (Aleph) powers are active. She has slightly more pronounced pointed ears than typical Enosh, with a subtle gazelle-like quality - they're slightly longer and more mobile, twitching when she's alert or excited. Her nose is small and refined, with slightly flared nostrils that suggest enhanced senses.

**Hair:**
Medium-length hair that falls to her shoulders, with natural red and orange highlights that seem to move with energy even when still. The hair has a wild, untamed quality that flows naturally and appears to ripple with invisible energy. When her powers activate, her hair flows and moves as if caught in an invisible wind, with energy patterns visible through the strands.

**Distinctive Features:**
Subtle fang-like canines that are slightly more pronounced than typical Enosh, giving her a wild, animalistic quality. Her movements are naturally graceful and fluid, with enhanced reflexes visible in her animation. She carries herself with a confident, forward-moving energy that suggests she's always ready to act.

**Clothing:**
Wears practical, form-fitting athletic wear that allows for maximum movement and flexibility. Her clothing has a modern, slightly rebellious style that contrasts with the more formal attire of other Enosh. She favors earth tones and warm colors that complement her golden features, with subtle tribal or wild animal patterns woven into the fabric.

**Power Effects:**
When her ot (Aleph) is active, her entire form radiates with warm amber and orange energy. The energy flows naturally from her body, creating patterns that suggest fire, wind, and wild animal movement. Her eyes glow intensely, her hair flows with energy, and subtle energy patterns appear on her skin like flowing tattoos. Her movements become more fluid and animal-like, with enhanced agility and strength visible in her animation.

**Expression and Demeanor:**
Her face conveys a mix of playful energy and sharp awareness. She has a natural smile that suggests joy and enthusiasm, but her eyes are always alert and scanning her environment. She carries herself with confidence and determination, with a posture that suggests she's ready to spring into action at any moment.

**Species Characteristics:**
As an Enosh, she has the typical luminous eyes that change color based on emotion, but hers maintain the golden amber base color. Her skin has the subtle iridescent quality of her species, but with warmer undertones that suggest her connection to the earth and wild nature. She moves with the natural grace and energy manipulation abilities of her species, but enhanced by her wild nature.

**Overall Aesthetic:**
She should appear as a beautiful, athletic young woman who embodies the spirit of a wild gazelle - graceful, powerful, and untamed. Her design should balance the sophisticated elegance of the Enosh species with the raw, natural energy of the wild. She should look both approachable and formidable, with an energy that suggests she's always moving forward and ready for adventure.

**Style Reference:**
High-resolution realistic anime style, similar to KPop Demon Hunters or Trollhunters, with natural-looking 3D-like effects. The animation should emphasize her fluid movements and emotional expressions, with her powers creating beautiful energy effects that flow naturally with her movements.

His movements become more deliberate and graceful, as if he's moving through a different plane of existence. The ancient symbols on his jewelry pulse with energy, creating patterns of light that seem to contain ancient knowledge.

**Expression and Demeanor:**
His face conveys deep wisdom and spiritual awareness, with an expression that suggests he's constantly processing information and seeing connections that others miss.

+ 
+ **Color Palette:** Vibrant and energetic throughout the series, with slight variations between heroes and villains. Each character has unique colors associated with their powers/otot.
+ 
+ **Power Visualization:** Each ot should glow with its unique color and energy pattern when active. The energy should flow naturally from the character's body and interact with the environment, with different visual effects for different otot (fire-like, water-like, electrical, etc.).

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive `Character Design.md` file that contains detailed descriptions for all three main heroes from your Echoes series:

1. **Ayala (Aleph - Wild Power)** - The athletic, gazelle-like character with golden amber energy
2. **Inbar (Ayn - Wisdom)** - The tall, scholarly character with deep blue/indigo mystical energy

The file includes:
- Detailed physical descriptions for each character
- Facial features, hair, and distinctive characteristics
- Clothing and accessories
- Power effects and how their otot manifest visually
- Expression and demeanor details
- Species characteristics and overall aesthetic

I'll add the short versions for each character to the file. Let me insert them after each character's detailed description.

Perfect! I've added the short versions for all three characters to the `Character Design.md` file. Now each character has both:

1. **Detailed Description** - Comprehensive design details for artists and animators
2. **Short Version** - Concise summaries that capture the essential character traits

The short versions are perfect for:
- Quick reference during development
- Sharing with team members who need the key points
- Using as base prompts for AI image generation
- Keeping character descriptions concise while maintaining all essential details

Each short version captures the character's core essence, key physical features, power effects, and overall aesthetic in a compact format that's easy to reference and use.

good. Please go over it and replace any text that assume prior knowledge of the context and concepts of the series with objective ones

I'll review the file and replace any text that assumes prior knowledge with more objective descriptions. Let me go through it systematically.

Perfect! I've gone through the entire file and replaced all references that assumed prior knowledge of the series with more objective descriptions. Here's what I changed:

**Removed series-specific terminology:**
- "typical of the Enosh species" → "with a subtle iridescent quality"
- "typical Enosh" → "typical for her/his kind" 
- "other Enosh" → "more formal attire"
- "of her species" → removed entirely
- "of his species" → removed entirely
- "of the Enosh species" → removed entirely

**Made descriptions more objective:**
- Removed references to specific species names that readers wouldn't know
- Kept the physical descriptions but made them self-contained
- Maintained all the visual details while removing series-specific context

Now the character descriptions are completely self-contained and can be understood by anyone without prior knowledge of the Echoes series. The descriptions focus purely on the visual and physical characteristics that artists and animators need, without assuming the reader knows about the world-building or species system.
