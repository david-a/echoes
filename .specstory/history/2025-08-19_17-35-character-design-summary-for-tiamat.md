Based on the information I found in the codebase, here's a short version of the character design for Tiamat:

## Tiamat (Tav - Control)

**Short Version:**
A tall, imposing female humanoid with perfect posture and regal bearing that commands absolute authority. She has sharp, commanding features with piercing eyes that seem to see through everything and judge all they observe. Her skin has the subtle iridescent quality typical of the Enosh species, but with a cold, aristocratic pallor that emphasizes her separation from others.

She wears elaborate, expensive clothing that emphasizes her status and wealth - luxurious fabrics with sharp lines and metallic accents that create an intimidating yet elegant appearance. Her ot (Tav) glows with a cold, golden color that represents wealth and control, surrounding her in an aura of oppressive authority.

Her movements are precise and calculated, with an air of absolute confidence that makes her appear untouchable and above everyone else. She carries herself with the bearing of one who has never known defeat or challenge, her presence creating an atmosphere of cold oppression and rigid order. She embodies the spirit of ultimate authority and control - beautiful, terrifying, and completely convinced of her right to rule.

**Essence:** Aristocracy, property, possession, race superiority, racial purity, separation, disconnection, order

**Personality:** Aristocratic, haughty, proud, controlling

**Plot Role:** Supreme leader and ideological figurehead

+ ### 4. Tiamat (Tav - Control)
+ 
+ **Physical Description:**
+ A tall, imposing female humanoid standing approximately 6'0" tall, with a commanding presence that dominates any room she enters. Her frame is elegant and statuesque, with perfect proportions that suggest both beauty and power. Her skin has the subtle iridescent quality typical of the Enosh species, but with a cold, aristocratic pallor that emphasizes her separation from others and her belief in racial superiority.
+ 
+ **Facial Features:**
+ Her face is angular and refined, with sharp, commanding features that convey absolute authority. Her most striking feature is her piercing eyes - large, cold, and calculating, with a color that shifts between icy blue and steel gray depending on her mood. When her ot (Tav) powers are active, her eyes become even more intense, appearing to glow with cold, golden light that seems to see through everything and judge all it observes. Her nose is straight and refined, with a slight aquiline quality that adds to her aristocratic appearance. Her lips are full but often set in a thin, disapproving line that suggests constant judgment.
+ 
+ **Hair:**
+ She has long, perfectly styled hair that falls past her shoulders, with a natural wave that suggests both luxury and control. The hair is typically dark brown or black, with subtle highlights that catch the light and emphasize its quality. Her hair is always immaculately groomed and styled, often arranged in elaborate braids or sophisticated updos that emphasize her status and wealth. When her powers are active, her hair appears to move with invisible energy, creating an aura of otherworldly authority.
+ 
+ **Distinctive Features:**
+ Her pointed ears are perfectly proportioned and often adorned with expensive jewelry that emphasizes her wealth and status. Her movements are precise and calculated, with a fluidity that suggests she's moving through a world she completely controls. She carries herself with an air of absolute confidence that commands attention and respect, though it's the respect born of fear rather than admiration. Her posture is always perfect, suggesting years of training in aristocratic comportment.
+ 
+ **Clothing:**
+ She wears elaborate, expensive clothing that emphasizes her status and wealth. Her garments are made from the finest materials - luxurious silks, rich velvets, and precious metals woven into the fabric. The clothing has sharp lines and metallic accents that create an intimidating yet elegant appearance. She favors deep, rich colors - deep purples, rich blacks, and metallic golds and silvers that emphasize her power and wealth. Her clothing often features intricate patterns and symbols that suggest ancient authority and mystical power.
+ 
+ **Accessories and Jewelry:**
+ She wears numerous pieces of expensive jewelry that are clearly ancient and powerful. These items are adorned with symbols that pulse with energy when her powers activate, creating patterns of light that seem to contain ancient authority. The jewelry is made from precious metals and stones, with some pieces appearing to be artifacts of great power. She often wears a crown or headpiece that emphasizes her role as supreme leader, with symbols that glow with cold, golden energy.
+ 
+ **Power Effects:**
+ When her ot (Tav) is active, her entire form radiates with cold, golden energy that represents control and authority. The energy surrounds her in precise, geometric patterns that suggest order and control, creating an aura of oppressive authority. Her eyes become more intense and otherworldly, appearing to see through reality itself. Her movements become more deliberate and commanding, as if she's moving through a world she completely dominates. The symbols on her jewelry pulse with energy, creating patterns of light that seem to contain the very essence of control and order.
+ 
+ **Expression and Demeanor:**
+ Her face conveys absolute authority and cold calculation, with an expression that suggests she's constantly evaluating and judging everything around her. She has a natural air of superiority that comes from absolute confidence in her right to rule, but her eyes are always alert and observant, constantly scanning for threats to her authority. She carries herself with regal dignity, moving with purpose and precision. Her presence is both intimidating and slightly terrifying, as if she holds the power to destroy or elevate anyone she encounters.
+ 
+ **Species Characteristics:**
+ She has luminous eyes that change color based on emotion, but hers maintain a colder, more calculating quality that suggests her separation from normal emotional responses. Her skin has a subtle iridescent quality with cooler undertones that emphasize her aristocratic nature and belief in racial purity. She moves with natural grace and energy manipulation abilities, enhanced by her absolute confidence and belief in her right to control others.
+ 
+ **Overall Aesthetic:**
+ She should appear as a beautiful, terrifying figure who embodies the spirit of absolute authority and control. Her design should balance sophisticated elegance with the cold, oppressive nature of unchecked power. She should look both approachable and completely untouchable, with an energy that suggests she exists on a different plane of existence where she is the ultimate authority.
+ 
+ **Short Version:**
+ A tall, imposing female humanoid with sharp, commanding features and piercing eyes that judge all they observe. She wears elaborate, expensive clothing with sharp lines and metallic accents that emphasize her status and wealth. Her ot (Tav) glows with cold, golden energy representing control and authority.

+ Her movements are precise and calculated, with an air of absolute confidence that makes her appear untouchable. She carries herself with regal bearing, creating an atmosphere of cold oppression and rigid order.
