I'll scan the surrounding lines in the song to match tone, meter, and rhyme before drafting complementary verses.

I opened the song section to match tone, meter, and the scene’s emotional beats, then drafted concise verses that build from first suspicion to empathy.

``` 
[Verse 1]
Candy‑coated city lights
Bitter aftertaste tonight
Polished smiles, rehearsed replies
Hairline cracks behind the lies

[Verse 2]
Separate lines that steal the hours
Silver badges pass them by
Little hands still building towers
While the rich ones touch the sky
```

- Kept imagery suggestive and character-driven to fit your preference for gradual reveal and essential lines [[memory:6657344], [memory:6648010]].

I'll update the song lyrics in the file by replacing the placeholder word and lines with completed verse lines that match rhyme and meter.

I'll fill the placeholders in `plot/season 1/episodes/s01e01 - A Perfect World.md` by replacing "(?)" with "eyes" in Verse 1 and the two "???" lines in Verse 2 with lines that match the established meter and rhyme.

Made the edits to complete the verse.

- Filled Verse 1: “Hairline cracks behind the eyes”
- Filled Verse 2: 
  - “Separate lines that steal the hours”
  - “Silver badges pass them by”

These match the song’s meter and rhyme with “replies” and “sky,” and track the scene’s growing awareness.
