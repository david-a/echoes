I'll open the episode file to update the lyrics placeholders, then replace the "(?)" word and the "???" lines with fitting lyrics.

Read file: undefined

I'll replace the placeholder word and lines in the lyrics with fitting text aligned to the episode's tone.

Filled the placeholders in the song lyrics.

- Replaced "(?)" with “gloss” to keep the rhyme and imagery of polished surfaces cracking.
- Wrote Verse 2 lines to match tone and meter:
  - “Quiet quotas, colder laws”
  - “Empty slogans on the walls”

If you want an alternate flavor (e.g., more personal/animal imagery to hint her Aleph nature), I can swap those lines.

- Edited `plot/season 1/episodes/s01e01 - A Perfect World.md` accordingly.
