I'll integrate the translated storyline by updating `plot/season 1/Season 1: Storyline.md` with Episodes 2–12 and a mid-season note, keeping the existing Episode 1 section intact. Now I’ll make that edit.

I translated the Hebrew storyline and integrated Episodes 2–12 plus the mid-season note into `plot/season 1/Season 1: Storyline.md`, keeping Episode 1 intact.

- Added complete English summaries for Episodes 2–12, including titled episodes: 7 “System Update”, 8 “The Signs”, 9 “Arov”, 10 “Arbeh”, 11 “Barad”, 12 “Choshekh”.
- Inserted a concise mid-season parallels/pivot section to reflect the Moses/Aaron/Miriam echoes and the capture/escape beat.
- Preserved existing structure and placeholders (e.g., Character Development Arcs).
