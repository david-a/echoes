I like this. 
Give me alternatives for line:
"Timecards bruise wrists; sirens purr like pets"

and for the word "badge"
Make them a bit more tight with the context of the series

_**Assistant**_

Let me pull key world terms from your docs to align the line alternatives and the “badge” synonym with canon terms. I'll scan the series resources and S1 storyline quickly.

### Alternatives for the line
- Quota cuffs bruise wrists; Lahav’s drones purr tame
- Shift-bands welt wrists; watch‑drones purr on cue
- Work‑collars scar wrists; Sheol’s sirens purr obedient
- Scan‑gates kiss bone; the watch‑net purrs content
- Quota ticks draw blood; Lahav’s optics purr satisfied
- Compliance bands cut; patrol drones purr domesticated
- Shift numbers brand skin; optic swarms purr tame
- Punch‑clock prints scars; enforcement sirens purr trained

### Alternatives to “badge” (series‑tighter)
- Depends on your crest
- Depends on your glyph
- Depends on your house‑crest
- Depends on your lineage mark
- Depends on your purity rank
- Depends on your clearance tier
- Depends on your risk score
- Depends on Lahav’s list

- If you want, tell me which combo you like and I’ll swap it into `s01e01 - A Perfect World.md`.

_**Assistant**_

Here are alternatives for "masking loss" that fit with "polished smiles":

- **Polished smiles, hiding pain**
- **Polished smiles, covering cracks**
- **Polished smiles, burying truth**
- **Polished smiles, sealing wounds**
- **Polished smiles, veiling scars**
- **Polished smiles, smothering cries**
- **Polished smiles, drowning sorrow**
- **Polished smiles, choking grief**
- **Polished smiles, suffocating hurt**
- **Polished smiles, swallowing tears**
- **Polished smiles, smothering screams**
- **Polished smiles, burying broken**
- **Polished smiles, hiding hollow**
- **Polished smiles, covering chaos**
- **Polished smiles, veiling violence**

The best ones that maintain the rhythm and meaning would be:
- **Polished smiles, hiding pain**
- **Polished smiles, covering cracks** 
- **Polished smiles, burying truth**

Which one resonates with you?
