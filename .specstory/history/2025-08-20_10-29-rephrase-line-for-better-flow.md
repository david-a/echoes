I'll help you change that line to better fit the previous dialogue. Let me first read the current file to see the context around line 167.

Read file: plot/season 1/episodes/s01e01 - A Perfect World.md

Now I can see the context. The line "I'm done miming lines in someone else's play" comes after "If perfect is a script, who gets a speaking part?" which is a metaphor about society being like a play where some people have speaking roles and others don't. Let me look at a bit more context to understand the flow better.

Perfect! Now I can see the full context. The line "I'm done miming lines in someone else's play" follows "If perfect is a script, who gets a speaking part?" which establishes the theatrical metaphor. The current line feels a bit disconnected from the flow. Let me suggest a better line that maintains the theatrical metaphor while flowing more naturally from the previous line.

I've changed the line to "I'm done playing my role in someone else's show" which:

1. **Maintains the theatrical metaphor** - "playing my role" and "someone else's show" continue the script/play theme
2. **Flows better** - "playing my role" connects more naturally to the previous line about "speaking parts"
3. **Feels more personal** - "my role" makes it more about Ayala's personal awakening rather than just "miming lines"
4. **Has better rhythm** - The new line has a more natural flow with the rap style of the verse

The change keeps the same meaning (rejecting the imposed societal role) while making it feel more integrated with the surrounding lyrics.
