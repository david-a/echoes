# Build complete script and setup for s01e02 (2025-08-20 20:57:47)

Please build the Complete Script & Setup for s01e02

I'll scan the existing episode, season overview, character bios, and design guides to align tone, arcs, and continuity before drafting s01e02. Then I'll create a new episode file under `plot/season 1/episodes/` with a complete setup and script outline.

I'll add a new episode file for s01e02 under `plot/season 1/episodes/` with a complete setup, scenes, song, and production notes, aligned to the season outline and character guides.

I reviewed S01 materials and created the full s01e02 episode file with scene beats, lyrics, and production notes. I aligned the tone to your “reveal-by-inches” preference and sparse, essential dialogue style [[memory:6657344]] [[memory:6649958]] [[memory:6648010]].

- Added: `plot/season 1/episodes/s01e02 - No Names.md`
- Contents: Overview, summary, 6 scenes, musical sequence “No Names” (lyrics included), VFX notes, musical production cues, themes/foreshadowing, and continuity hooks to E03.

Would you like me to also produce a Hebrew version of s01e02, or iterate any beats (e.g., make the control-room tag feel more like Lahav than a generic operator)?

- New file created: `plot/season 1/episodes/s01e02 - No Names.md`
- Focus: Ayala meets masked Inbar/Matar; leverage without violence; song “No Names”; closing sting reveals surveillance reporting to Tiamat.
