# Assessing project feasibility and simplification (2025-08-21 03:14:00)

_**User**_

look at this project. I'm trying to produce this project on my own. is it feasible? how can I simplify it so I can produce the first season or at least few episodes in few weeks? the most concerning is of course the visuals and particularly the animations. all the rest (writing, music etc) I got it I think

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll scan the key docs (storyline, episodes, characters, resources, design guide) to gauge scope and then suggest a concrete, timeboxed production plan with simplifications focused on visuals/animation.

### Feasibility (solo, a few weeks)
- **Yes—if you embrace limited animation and a tight asset kit.** Your scripts already favor close-ups, minimal dialogue, and gradual reveal, which is perfect for low-cost production.
- Target a **3-episode “pilot arc” (E01–E02–E03)** at 90–120s each. With the right pipeline, you can ship the first 1–2 in ~2 weeks, then iterate faster.

### How to simplify visuals/animation (biggest impact, lowest cost)
- **Lock a 2.5D style**: painted/AI-assisted backgrounds + parallax + minimal character rigs. Use camera motion, lighting, and FX to sell energy.
- **Close-ups > full-body**: hands, eyes, silhouettes, over-shoulders. Masks (E02) reduce lip-sync costs to near-zero.
- **Tiny rig packs (per hero)**: 6–8 core poses, 3–4 expressions, 3 mouth shapes max, 3–4 hand shapes. Reuse across episodes.
- **FX-as-lighting** for otot: simple glows, Add/Screen overlays, animated masks, displacement ripples. No heavy particles or simulations.
- **Montage for scope**: injustice vignettes as stills with Ken Burns + sound design; suggest crowds via silhouettes and SFX.
- **One-time environment kit**: 3 hero sets for S01E01–E02
  - City vista (1 wide matte + 2 crops)
  - Safe room interior (E02, reused later)
  - Control room wide (single hero shot reused for stings)

### Suggested toolchain (Mac-friendly)
- **Design/Backgrounds**: Photoshop/Krita or SD/MJ for concept plates → paintover.
- **Rig/Comp**: After Effects (Duik or Joysticks ‘n Sliders) or Spine/Live2D. If you know Blender, Grease Pencil works too.
- **FX**: AE native (Glow, Displacement Map, Turbulent Displace, Fractal Noise); no plugins needed.
- **AI assists (optional, fast)**: Stable Diffusion + ControlNet for pose-consistent character stills; AnimateDiff/EbSynth for micro-motions; Runway/Pika for texture loops (as background elements), then comp in AE.

### Asset kit to build once (and reuse)
- **Characters**: Ayala, Inbar, Matar rigs (front + 3/4), 6–8 poses, 3–4 expressions, 3 mouths, hands set, masked variants.
- **FX presets**: Aleph/Ayn/Mem glow comps (color, pulse timing), ripple/displace comp, surveillance HUD overlay.
- **Background pack**: 
  - City: morning, market, industrial district (wide + two punch-ins each)
  - Safe room: 3 angles
  - Control room: 1 wide + 1 monitor close
- **UI/Screens**: waveform line, REC dot, tagging animation, lower-contrast grids.

### Episode-specific simplifications
- S01E01 “A Perfect World”
  - Reduce to **3 locations**: bedroom window, market corner, industrial alley/factory door.
  - “Injustices” as **5 stills** with sound-driven cuts; avoid animated crowds.
  - “City distortion” = **displacement map** pass + color shift + vignette.
  - Abduction = **audio + black + quick fragment shots** (hands/eyes/crate edges).
- S01E02 “No Names”
  - Mostly **close shots in one set**; masks for half the runtime.
  - Musical sequence uses **light pulses on walls + ot overlays**, minimal body motion.
  - Control room = **single wide matte** with UI overlays for the sting.

### Shot budget per 90–120s episode (keeps it shippable)
- 12–16 total shots.
- 3–4 “hero” shots with light motion/rigging.
- 6–8 stills with parallax/camera moves.
- 2–4 pure inserts (hands, screens, silhouettes).

### 2-week plan to ship 1–2 episodes
- Days 1–2: Lock styleframes (8–10), finalize 3 backgrounds, build Ayala rig v1, create ot FX presets, temp vocal/instrumental, animatic E01.
- Days 3–5: Animate E01 (parallax, ot FX, limited rig moments). Sound design and grade.
- Day 6: Polish/QC E01. In parallel, finalize safe room background variants.
- Days 7–9: Build Inbar/Matar simple rigs + masked variants. Animatic E02. Animate musical beat + key close-ups.
- Days 10–12: Finish E02, control room sting, mix/grade. Social cuts.
- Buffer: 1–2 days contingency.

### Production rules to stay fast
- Limit each scene to **one lighting setup**; sell beat changes with color/shape overlays and SFX.
- Record VO tight; **avoid back-and-forth coverage**—hold on faces/hands.
- Keep ot pulses **on musical grid**; re-use timing comps across episodes.
- Export master at **4K** for future reuse; deliver 16:9 and 9:16 crops.

### If time gets tight: motion-comic fallback
- 100% stills + camera + FX; animated lyrics overlays for the song sections; keep ot pulses and color beats. You can still publish weekly.

### What I’d do next (48-hour sprint)
- Create 6 styleframes (3 from E01 montage, 3 from E02 safe room).
- Build Ayala minimal rig + Aleph FX comp.
- Produce a 10–15s E02 “Hush Room” test (masked dialogue + ot pulse). If it lands, proceed with the plan immediately.

- If you want, I can draft the exact AE comp structure and a one-page shot list for E01 and E02 you can execute step-by-step. 

- High-level outcome: You’ll publish a coherent visual style, keep animation time sane, and build an asset kit that scales to the rest of S01 without redoing work.

- Delivered a concise feasibility read and a practical plan focused on minimal rigs, 2.5D backgrounds, and reusable FX; scoped E01/E02 into low-cost shots and provided a two-week schedule to ship the first 1–2 episodes.

S01E01: Say I want to use ai for all character and background designs, and for animation. come up with a cohesive workflow, what image assets to create (including all prompts), and complete list of starting images and prompts for img2video. integrate it all in the relevant places in @s01e01 - A Perfect World.md 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll add a structured AI production workflow, asset lists with concrete prompts, and per-scene img2video prompts into the S01E01 document, then link them to the scene breakdown so you can produce quickly.

---



---



---

I’m going to add an “AI Production Workflow & Assets” section into `s01e01 - A Perfect World.md`, including global settings, a complete asset list with prompts, and a per‑scene img2video shot plan cross-referenced to scenes. Then I’ll mark the corresponding todos complete and set the next one in progress.

---



---



---

I'll reopen the episode file to match exact context and insert the AI workflow section at the right spot.

---

---



---

Adding the AI production workflow and asset prompts section into the episode file, positioned after the Animation Style section, then I’ll update the todo statuses.

---



---



---



---

- I added a complete “AI Production Workflow & Assets (E01)” section into `plot/season 1/episodes/s01e01 - A Perfect World.md`, right after the Animation Style.
- It includes: global settings, character/background/FX asset lists with concrete prompts, and a per‑scene img2video shot plan with start-frame composition guidance and motion notes. Also added suggested generation settings and a short production order.

Want me to generate equivalent sections for S01E02 next, or refine the prompts for a specific AI stack you’re using (MJ/SDXL/Runway/Luma/Pika)?

- Inserted a cohesive AI workflow, prompts, and img2video shot plan into `s01e01 - A Perfect World.md`.

_**User**_

img2video - instead of using the base images we created, we just need to use them as reference (pose/face/depth/overall/etc) to generate a starting frame for each shot. no manual editing required. add the prompt for each such txt2image starting frame before the animation prompt 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll update the img2video section to use txt2image-generated start frames with reference controls and insert per-shot start frame prompts before each animation prompt, then validate and update todos.

---

Read file: undefined

---



---

I’m going to update the img2video section to generate txt2image start frames using references (identity/pose/depth) and insert a “Start frame (txt2image) prompt” before each shot’s animation prompt, plus adjust the usage note accordingly. Then I’ll validate and update the TODOs.

---



---



---



---

- I updated the img2video section to generate txt2image start frames per shot using references (identity/pose/depth), then run the animation step. Each shot now has a “Start frame (txt2image) prompt” inserted before the animation prompt.
- Usage note now reflects “generate start frames via txt2image with references” instead of manual compositing.

Want me to add a tiny “References how-to” snippet (e.g., SDXL + ControlNet Depth/OpenPose settings and how to point to your AYALA_BASE and background plates) at the top of that section?

---

_**User**_

I want the character and world design to be richer, deeper. 
Let's create an arsenal of assets to represent the different resources we'll use in the episodes even before getting to designing the actual characters - the different species overall look, their habitat, the Golden city wide shots and specific areas. we want to make each species unique but not so deep (so for example Ayala can look Enoshi but is actually Feroxi). Also keep in mind that the audience (and even most of the heros or extras) aren't aware that the city is floating, until the cliffhanger in the end of the s01. in s01 the different species live in a minified and unrbanized version of their natural habitat. In the next seasons we'll introduce the other parts of the world, where there are other cities, forests, oceans etc. 
Please change the necessary files to fit the above, and create a new Resources Design file with all the necessary prompts to create all the assets needed for a complete view of the world we know in s01

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll add a new "Resources Design - S01 Assets.md" with comprehensive prompts, and update `Resources.md` and `Design Guide Q&A.md` to reflect S01 constraints: subtle species differences, mini-urban habitats, and the floating city reveal. Then I’ll validate and mark tasks done.

---



---



---

I’m going to create a new file with S01 asset prompts, and update `Resources.md` and `Design Guide Q&A.md` to reflect the subtle species differences, mini-urban habitats, and the floating-city reveal policy. Then I’ll check for any issues and mark the tasks complete.

---



---



---



---



---



---



---



---

- I created `Resources Design - S01 Assets.md` with a complete Season 1 asset kit: Golden City plates, mini-urban habitats per species, props, extras, enforcers, UI/HUD motifs, lighting variants, and ControlNet/consistency notes. Prompts are concise and production-ready, with reveal safeguards.
- I updated `Resources.md` to add “S01 Visual Constraints and Reveal Policy” and pointed to the new assets file.
- I updated `Design Guide Q&A.md` to align with S01 rules: subtle species differences, mini-habitats inside the city, and floating-city reveal only in the finale.

Want me to generate a first batch of 10–12 key styleframes (one per location/habitat) with exact txt2image prompts and seeds you can run immediately?

---

_**User**_

each prompt should be self-contained with all the info needed + if there's a reference image needed that we created before

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I’m going to add a “Per-Asset Generation Details (Self-contained prompts)” section to `Resources Design - S01 Assets.md` with explicit model/settings, seeds, negative prompts, and reference images/ControlNet per item. Then I’ll update the start frame prompts in `s01e01 - A Perfect World.md` to list explicit reference file paths and ControlNet usage. I'll mark the tasks done afterward.

---



---



---

I'll add self-contained generation details (model/settings/seeds/refs) to the S01 asset prompts and update E01 start-frame prompts with explicit reference file paths and ControlNet usage.

- I made every asset prompt self-contained with model, settings, seed, negatives, and explicit references where needed in `Resources Design - S01 Assets.md` under “Per‑Asset Generation Details (Self‑contained)”.
- I updated the E01 start‑frame prompts in `s01e01 - A Perfect World.md` to include explicit file paths for references and ControlNet usage (OpenPose/Depth/Reference), plus seeds and settings.

Want me to produce a compact CSV/JSON export of all prompts and parameters so you can batch-run them?

---

_**User**_

ALL prompts need to be self contained so a img generator can generate it without any prior knowledge of the context (other than a global negative prompt and other reference image/s that mentioned there). for global additions put them on the top of the page and name them as unique variable names

- Added GLOBAL_* variables at the top of `Resources Design - S01 Assets.md` and ensured all executable prompts in “Per‑Asset Generation Details” are self‑contained with model, sampler, size, steps, cfg, negatives, and explicit refs. You can now run any single prompt with just the global negative and any listed reference images.
- Left the earlier “brief” sections as planning guides; the “Per‑Asset Generation Details” section is the canonical, ready-to-run set.

Want me to convert “Per‑Asset Generation Details” into a JSON or CSV manifest for batch generation?

_**User**_

the images of the landscapes all come out dull and usual. nothing like the extraordinary world and people I envisioned

---

_**Assistant**_



---



---



---

Try the boosted prompts I added: they now include style/lighting/color directives and “extraordinary” material/cultural motifs, plus hires upscaling and optional Tile ControlNet for detail.

Quick tips to avoid dull results:
- Use the new variables GLOBAL_STYLE_BOOST, GLOBAL_COLOR_SCRIPT, GLOBAL_HQ_UPSCALE in each prompt; they push composition, lighting, and detail.
- For key plates, enable ControlNet Tile at weight ~0.6 after initial generation for micro‑detailing.
- Slightly raise steps (36–40) and keep CFG around 6–7 to avoid mushy or overbaked looks.

If a shot still feels plain, I can tailor a “hero” version of that location with stronger landmark features without breaking S01’s reveal rules.

There are two moons in the planet where golden city lives. one is artificial and was once inhabited but now only hollow ruins. the second is natural but has rust-y tone. update everywhere that's relevant

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the relevant prompts to include the dual moon system and their distinct characteristics throughout the S01 assets.

I've updated all the night scene prompts in `Resources Design - S01 Assets.md` to include the dual moon system:

- Added `GLOBAL_MOON_SYSTEM` variable describing both moons
- Updated all night scene prompts to reference "dual moonlight (artificial moon's cold blue-white and natural moon's rust-red)"
- This creates layered lighting effects and atmospheric depth in night shots

The dual moon system now appears in:
- Civic Core Plaza (Night)
- Sylvari Atrium Courtyard (Night) 
- Aquarii Canal Walk (Night)
- Ferox Market Alley (Night)
- Abandoned Factory – Loading Dock (Night)
- Umbra Shadow Arcade (Night)

This should give your night scenes much more visual interest and atmospheric depth while maintaining the S01 reveal constraints.

They sometimes show at day, faint opcaity in the sky. extract the moons description to a variable and put where's necessary

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll extract the moon descriptions to a variable and add them to day scenes where they would be faintly visible.

Perfect! I've updated the `Resources Design - S01 Assets.md` file to include the dual moon system in both day and night scenes:

**Changes made:**

1. **Updated `GLOBAL_MOON_SYSTEM` variable** to include day visibility: "faint opacity in day sky"

2. **Added dual moons to all day/afternoon scenes:**
   - **Civic Core Plaza (Day)**: "faint dual moons in sky"
   - **Market Arcade (Day)**: "faint dual moons visible through skylight" 
   - **Residential Terraces (Afternoon)**: "faint dual moons in sky"
   - **Industrial Belt – Service Road (Dusk)**: "faint dual moons in sky"
   - **Sylvari Atrium Courtyard (Day)**: "faint dual moons visible through canopy gaps"
   - **Aquarii Canal Walk (Day)**: "faint dual moons reflected in water"
   - **Ferox Market Alley (Afternoon)**: "faint dual moons in sky"

3. **All night scenes already had** the dual moonlight effects from the previous update

The moons now appear consistently throughout the world with:
- **Day scenes**: Faint opacity in the sky or reflected in water/surfaces
- **Night scenes**: Prominent lighting effects with distinct shadows
- **Artificial moon**: Cold blue-white light (hollow ruins)
- **Natural moon**: Rust-red tone (warmer light)

This creates a cohesive visual system that subtly reinforces the dual moon concept throughout all scenes while maintaining the S01 reveal constraints.

_**User**_

replace with GLOBAL_MOON_SYSTEM wherever trying to describe the moons 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll replace all the detailed moon descriptions with the `GLOBAL_MOON_SYSTEM` variable throughout the file.

Now I'll replace all the detailed moon descriptions with the `GLOBAL_MOON_SYSTEM` variable:

I need to replace each instance individually. Let me do them one by one:

Perfect! I've successfully replaced all the detailed moon descriptions throughout the `Resources Design - S01 Assets.md` file with the `GLOBAL_MOON_SYSTEM` variable. 

**All moon references now use the variable:**

- **Day/Afternoon scenes**: `faint dual moons in sky (${GLOBAL_MOON_SYSTEM})`
- **Night scenes**: `dual moonlight (${GLOBAL_MOON_SYSTEM})` with various effects
- **Specific locations**: `dual moons visible through skylight (${GLOBAL_MOON_SYSTEM})`, `dual moons reflected in water (${GLOBAL_MOON_SYSTEM})`, etc.

This makes the file much cleaner and easier to maintain. If you ever want to adjust the moon descriptions (like changing the colors, adding more details about the hollow ruins, etc.), you only need to update the `GLOBAL_MOON_SYSTEM` variable at the top of the file, and it will automatically apply to all the prompts throughout.

_**User**_

all variables should go at the end of the prompt

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll move all the variables to the end of each prompt for consistency.

Let me check the current structure and move the variables to the end:
