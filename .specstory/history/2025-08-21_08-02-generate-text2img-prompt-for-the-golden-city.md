_**Assistant**_

I'll read the episode file to understand the context and setting for the first scene of The Golden City.

Read file: plot/season 1/episodes/s01e01 - A Perfect World.md

Based on the episode script, I can see that the first scene shows The Golden City from Ayala's bedroom window before zooming into her room. Here's a text2img prompt for that establishing shot:

**Text2img Prompt:**
```
Aerial view of a pristine futuristic cityscape at dawn, The Golden City, with gleaming skyscrapers reflecting golden sunlight, clean geometric architecture, advanced technology visible in the infrastructure, perfect symmetry and order, upper-class residential district with elegant buildings, morning mist creating a dreamy atmosphere, cinematic lighting, hyperrealistic, 8K quality
```

This prompt captures the "perfect world" illusion that the episode begins with - showing the city as it appears to be before Ayala's awakening reveals the hidden darkness beneath the surface.
