We're going to continue writing the first season. Currently on @s01e02.md 

The way we do this is first write the summary (already done), then create the song and name of the episode that represent the main idea of it, then generate the whole flow, setup and script of the episode.

Based on the episode summary, here are 10 episode name ideas with their core concepts:

## Episode Name Ideas

### 1. **"Unmasked"**
**Core Idea:** The literal unmasking of Inbar becomes a metaphor for revealing hidden truths and the vulnerability that comes with exposure. The episode explores how secrets can't stay hidden forever.

### 2. **"Safe Room"**
**Core Idea:** The irony of a "safe" room that's actually dangerous, representing the false security of ignorance versus the perilous truth. The room becomes a metaphor for the characters' psychological states.

### 3. **"Flicker"**
**Core Idea:** Ayala's flickering ot represents her wavering between safety and truth, between running away and staying to uncover what's really happening. The flicker becomes a visual metaphor for uncertainty.

### 4. **"Parley"**
**Core Idea:** The tense negotiation between three people who don't trust each other but need to work together. The word suggests a temporary truce in a larger conflict, which is exactly what happens.

### 5. **"Echo Chamber"**
**Core Idea:** The safe room becomes an echo chamber where secrets bounce around, and the characters' voices echo their internal conflicts. Also hints at the surveillance aspect with Lahav listening in.

### 6. **"Brittle Truce"**
**Core Idea:** The fragile nature of the agreement they reach - it's temporary, easily broken, and built on mutual distrust. The word "brittle" suggests something that will shatter under pressure.

### 7. **"First Contact"**
**Core Idea:** This is literally the first real contact between Ayala and the organization. It's awkward, dangerous, and full of miscommunication - like an alien first contact scenario.

### 8. **"The Recording"**
**Core Idea:** Ayala's act of recording Inbar becomes the central power shift in the episode. It's both a threat and a form of protection, representing how information can be both weapon and shield.

### 9. **"Three Voices"**
**Core Idea:** The episode features three distinct musical voices (Inbar's electronics, Matar's water whispers, Ayala's EDM) that must find harmony despite their differences. Also represents the three characters learning to communicate.

### 10. **"Behind the Mask"**
**Core Idea:** Literally about Inbar removing his mask, but also about the characters revealing their true selves and intentions. The mask represents the lies and secrets they've been hiding.

Each title captures different aspects of the episode's themes: secrecy, trust, revelation, and the fragile nature of alliances. Which direction resonates most with the tone you want to establish for this episode?

I like the idea of Unmasked.

- **Recommended chant word: "Galui" (גָּלוּי)** — means “revealed/unmasked.” Fits the title and the moment Inbar’s face is seen.

- Alternatives:
  - **"Hineni" (הִנֵּנִי)**: “Here I am” — Ayala’s choice to return.
  - **"Masach" (מָסָךְ)**: “Veil/screen/mask” — tension of the thing being removed.
  - **"Sod" (סוֹד)**: “Secret” — whispered counterpoint.
  - **"Nistar" (נִסְתָּר)**: “Hidden” — contrasts “Unmasked.”
  - **"Emet" (אֱמֶת)**: “Truth” — the core stake.
  - **"Or" (אוֹר)**: “Light” — revelation vibe.
  - **"Shema" (שְׁמַע)**: “Listen” — surveillance motif.
