_**User**_

Consider the following prompt, give me an adapted "Clothing" and "Background" sections to fit a reel where Ayala sits on her bed in her bedroom and happily talking to her audience in the morning about her upcoming day.


----
Subject: A beautiful, half-elf woman with striking features and a serious expression.

Art Style: A realistic digital painting with a smooth, almost airbrushed finish, giving it a polished look. The details are crisp, and the lighting is soft and flattering.

Hair: Dark brown hair with subtle red highlights, styled in a messy half-ponytail with strands framing her face.

Clothing: A form-fitting olive green tank top paired with olive green cargo pants, cinched with a black belt. The outfit is casual and functional.

Ears: Prominent elf ears, a key feature of the subject.

Lighting: Soft, directional lighting that highlights her facial features and the contours of her body, creating a sense of depth and dimension.

Vibe: Confident and Cheerful, with a hint of mystery. The overall feel is modern fantasy or a sci-fi character.

Looking at the prompt and considering the context of Ayala sitting on her bed in her bedroom for a morning reel, I'll adapt the "Clothing" and "Background" sections to fit this scenario:

**Clothing:** A soft, comfortable sleep shirt or loose tank top in warm earth tones (perhaps a faded olive green or warm beige), paired with cozy pajama pants or soft cotton shorts. The outfit should look lived-in and comfortable, perfect for a relaxed morning conversation. Maybe a cardigan or light robe draped nearby for that cozy bedroom feel.

**Background:** A warm, inviting bedroom setting with soft morning light streaming through partially drawn curtains or blinds. The bed should be the focal point - perhaps a comfortable mattress with rumpled sheets and a few decorative pillows. Warm wood furniture, maybe a bedside table with a lamp, some personal touches like books or small trinkets. The overall atmosphere should feel cozy and personal, like someone's actual living space rather than a staged set. The lighting should be gentle and warm, creating that peaceful morning mood perfect for intimate audience engagement.

This adaptation maintains Ayala's character while shifting from the more action-ready outfit to something more appropriate for a morning bedroom setting, and transforms the background from a generic environment to a specific, cozy bedroom that enhances the intimate, personal nature of the reel.
