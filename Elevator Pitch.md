# **Echoes: Worlds Collide** - Elevator Pitch

## **The Hook (30 seconds)**

**"Echoes: Worlds Collide"** is a groundbreaking animated music series where every episode is a (2/3/5 TBD)-minute musical journey through a sci-fi universe on the brink of dimensional collapse. Three heroes with mysterious pasts awaken to discover they're not just fighting for freedom—they're fighting to prevent reality itself from unraveling.

## **The Concept (60 seconds)**

In a universe where one species has enslaved others, three young heroes from the dominant race begin experiencing strange déjà vu and unexplained powers. As they uncover the truth about their world's exploitation, they discover something far more terrifying: parallel dimensions are collapsing into each other, and their "memories" are actually encounters with versions of themselves from other worlds.

Each episode features an original song sung by the character it highlights, blending EDM, rock, and electronic music as the heroes' powers and secrets unfold. The series starts as a rebellion story but evolves into an epic quest to stabilize the fabric of reality itself.

## **The Unique Angle (30 seconds)**

**"Echoes"** is the first animated series where every episode is a complete musical experience—think "Hamilton" meets "Rick and Morty" meets "The Matrix." The heroes' personal secrets (each revealed in separate seasons) create immediate character drama, while the dimensional collapse concept provides an ever-expanding scope that keeps audiences guessing.

**Unique Edge:** The series draws from ancient Hebrew/Semitic mythology and the concept of "Otot" (signals/miracles) rather than overused Nordic runes. Each character's power is tied to an ancient Hebrew letter with deep mystical significance—signals from another dimension, divine intervention, or reflections of inner truth. This creates a fresh, culturally rich foundation that sets the series apart from typical fantasy content. The different episodes will sometime introduce characters, monsters and entities that have deep connections to the ancient mythology.

## **The Market (15 seconds)**

Perfect for Gen Z and Millennial audiences who love animated series, musical content, and complex storytelling. Each episode works as standalone content for social media while building a larger narrative for dedicated fans.

## **The Promise (15 seconds)**

A series that starts as a simple rebellion story but becomes an epic multiversal saga about love, identity, and the choices we make when reality itself is at stake.
