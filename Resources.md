# The Animated Music Series - Echoes: Worlds Collide

## General Concept

The series is a short-episode musical animation (up to two minutes per episode) that will be published on Instagram and YouTube.
Each episode features an original song that corresponds with the theme or plot situation.
Goal: Promote music channels (Spotify, etc.), build an audience around the series, and eventually live performances.

## Story World

The series takes place in a multi-world and multi-species universe, similar to Star Wars/Marvel.
One species has taken control over the other species, enslaving and exploiting them.
Three heroes from the same dominant species awaken, understand the madness, and try to stop it.
They face both the fixations and rigidity of their own people, and the suspicion and anger of the enslaved species.
The hidden metaphor: Humanity versus animals (exploitation, control, awakening).
Tone: Light, enjoyable, with subtle tension and dark humor.

## Episode Structure

- Length: 1:30--2 minutes
- Opening: A short scene presenting a problem/situation
- Body: Action or discovery by the characters
- Song (30--60 seconds) reflecting a perspective or emotion
- Ending: A small cliffhanger that leads to the next episode

## Musical Performance Structure

- Each episode's song is primarily sung by the character it highlights
- Supporting characters may feature in duets or ensemble moments
- Songs reflect the character's emotional state, perspective, or power awakening
- Musical style evolves as characters develop and their secrets are revealed

## Seasonal Progression

- Each season reveals deeper layers of complexity and evil
- Larger "boss" figures emerge as the heroes progress
- Each hero has a secret from their past that gets revealed in a separate season
- These revelations cause major plot shifts (midpoint crises or resolutions)
- The true scope of the conflict expands with each revelation
- **Dimensional Collapse:** The "déjà vu" and "repeating cycle" hints are actually from parallel dimensions collapsing into each other
- **Escalating Scope:** The journey evolves from saving enslaved beings → stabilizing dimensional boundaries → preventing complete reality collapse

## Dimensional Collapse Concept

- **The True Crisis:** An unknown villain/force is causing different worlds/dimensions to merge. The Audience will initially be led to believe that it's the dominant species, but will later be revealed that it's a different force.
- **Naming:** The name "worlds collide" is a reference to the concept of parallel dimensions colliding, but initially the audience will think that it refers to the worlds that the dominant species has enslaved.
- **Déjà Vu Explained:** The audience will be initially led to believe that the Dejà vu's and strange feelings is something from the past, but it's actually from a parallel dimension as the worlds are colliding, collapsing to each other. Characters experience familiarity because they're encountering versions of themselves from other dimensions
- **Love Across Dimensions:** Heroes may fall in love with parallel versions of each other, creating heartbreaking choices
- **Stabilization Mission:** The ultimate goal becomes preventing complete dimensional collapse while maintaining the separation between worlds
- **Inner Conflicts:** Characters must choose between their current reality and parallel versions of loved ones
- **The Hidden Villain:** The true antagonist is manipulating dimensional boundaries for unknown purposes
