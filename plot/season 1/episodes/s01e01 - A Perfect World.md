**Lyrics (English):**

```
[Verse 1]
Candy‑coated city lights
Bitter aftertaste tonight
Polished smiles, magic sauce
Hairline cracks behind the gloss

[Chorus]
Perfect world, perfect lies
I can see through your disguise
Perfect world, endless pain
I won't turn away again

[Verse 2 - Talk rap]
Okay—talk to me, real slow, real low
"Smile. Comply." That's the mantra they sold
Sidewalks mutter names I don't even know

Posters preach "Order," the alley sells "Hunger"
Timecards prints scars; sirens scream like thunder
I ask, is this normal? "Depends on your color"

How could I miss it? it feels like a complete change of heart
If perfect is a script, who gets a speaking part?
I'm done playing a role in this crooked act

[Chorus]
Perfect world, perfect lies
I can see through your disguise
Perfect world, endless pain
I won't turn away again

[Bridge]
Something's calling me, something wild and free
I can feel it in my heart, it's who I'm meant to be
No more perfect world, no more perfect lies
I'm opening my heart, I'm opening my eyes

[Final Chorus]
Perfect world, perfect lies
I can see through your disguise
Perfect world, endless pain
I won't turn away again
```

   - A young non-Enosh worker being berated for dropping a crate of goods
   - The worker's hands are shaking from exhaustion, but they're forced to continue
   - Other workers nearby work faster, heads down, avoiding the supervisor's attention
   - Ayala sees the fear in their eyes - this isn't just a bad day, it's their daily reality

2. **Construction Site (0:55-1:05):**

   - Non-Enosh workers carrying heavy materials while Enosh supervisors watch from shade
   - One worker stumbles under the weight, and an enforcer immediately yells at them
   - The worker apologizes profusely, but the enforcer threatens them with "consequences"
   - Ayala notices the worker's family waiting nearby - they look worried and hungry
   - The contrast between the luxurious buildings being built and the workers' living conditions

   - Non-Enosh children being turned away from a prestigious school
   - Their parents are told "this institution is not for your kind"
