```
[Verse 1]
Candy‑coated city lights
Bitter aftertaste tonight
Polished smiles, masking loss
Hairline cracks behind the gloss

[Chorus]
Perfect world, perfect lies
I can see through your disguise
Perfect world, endless pain
I won't turn away again

[Verse 2]
Quiet quotas, colder laws
Empty slogans on the walls
Little hands still building towers
While the rich ones touch the sky

[Chorus]
Perfect world, perfect lies
I can see through your disguise
Perfect world, endless pain
I won't turn away again

[Bridge]
Something's calling me, something wild and free
I can feel it in my heart, it's who I'm meant to be
No more perfect world, no more perfect lies
I'm opening my heart, I'm opening my eyes

[Final Chorus]
Perfect world, perfect lies
I can see through your disguise
Perfect world, endless pain
I won't turn away again
```
