## Episode Summary

Immediately after the abduction, Ayala wakes in a dim safe room with two masked rescuers/interrogators. They try to scare her off and send her home. She bolts—but her flickering ot and conscience pull her back. Outside, she waits; when Matar steps out, Ayala slips back in and catches Inbar unmasked. In a comic beat she records him and deadpans that she’ll report him. Matar returns; a terse parley follows—only essentials. As the trio reach a brittle, temporary truce, we reveal a dark figure of a person (later will be realized as Lahav) seen from his back sitting in a distant control room quietly listening. He's dispatching an enforcer to report to "Her" (Tiamat).

### "Unmasked" - Lyrics

[Ayala (female)]
Oh, my head! what's this noise?
Who's there? where am I? what's this place?
Release me! let me go!
Release me! let me go!

[Inbar (male)]
We're asking the questions.
You stepped into the wrong place.
What's your name?
What were you doing out here?

[Ayala (female)]
I don't know what you're talking about.
I was just walking home and took a wrong turn.
Release me! let me go!
Release me! let me go!

[Inbar (male)]
Relax, תֵּרָגְעִי,
Take a breath.
We're not here to hurt you.
But you need to answer some questions.

[Matar (female)]
We're not going to hurt you.
We'll let you go but you can never talk about us with anyone,
We will know.
We will know.
We will know.

[High paced Instrumental]

[Ayala (female)]
Running for my life.
My legs want to get home.
But my heart won't let me go!
my heart won't let me go!

[C Part - Ayala (female)]
I cannot unsee what I have seen, unhear what I've heard.
I must return. I can't turn away.
I'm not afraid anymore.
